# Sells-Analysis-
This project involves analyzing sales data to gain insights into various aspects of the business. Let me break it down in a more human-friendly way:
Understanding Relationships: The project begins by looking at how different factors in the sales data relate to each other. It's like figuring out which things go hand in hand or have an impact on each other.
Visualizing Connections: To make things clearer, the code creates visual representations, like heatmaps and bar graphs. Think of it as turning raw data into colorful pictures that help us see patterns and trends easily.
Total Sales Calculation: A new metric, 'Total Sales,' is introduced by multiplying the quantity of items sold with their respective prices. This gives a more comprehensive view of the business's financial performance.
Identifying Best Performing Month: The project then identifies the month when the business had the highest sales. It's like finding out when the store was bustling with customers and making the most money.
City-wise Sales Analysis: By looking at the sales data city-wise, the code identifies which city contributed the most to the overall sales. It's similar to recognizing the most profitable location for the business.
Popular Products: The code analyzes which products are selling the most. Imagine knowing the favorite items that customers keep coming back for.
Top Products Overall: It also highlights the overall top-selling products, giving a sense of what items are consistently popular across the board.
Histogram Analysis: The code creates a histogram, which is like a visual summary of sales distribution over time. It helps in understanding patterns and variations.
Mean Calculation: Finally, the code calculates the average (mean) of selected variables, providing a general understanding of the typical quantity ordered and average price.
In simple terms, this project digs into sales data, paints a vivid picture of what's happening, and answers questions like when the business did the best, where it thrives the most, and what products customers love. It's like having a friendly guide to navigate through the business's success stories hidden in the numbers.
